As of writing this readme file I don't expect to have a final program. While
developing the program I repeatedly encountered segmentation fault errors that
I was unable to determine the source of, which made testing the other functions
(i.e. deadlock prevention alogrithm) nearly impossible.

I have developed functions for messaging between user and oss process signaling
request, release, and terminaton from user to oss; granting resources,
blocking, and unblocking signals from oss to user; and writing a table of
allocated resources to data.log files.

The program is currently unable to complete the task set out by the project but
I won't be able to complete a working program by the due date.
